Welcome to the i9300_emmc_toolbox wiki!

This will guide you on how to revive a bricked EMMC Galaxy S3 (for now only i9300)

**First step: [Determining your type of brick ](https://github.com/theandroid02/i9300_emmc_toolbox/wiki/Determining-your-type-of-brick)**

**Caution: You will lose your EFS partition, but there's not much to do about it.**

_This project is experimental in its nature and I take absolutely no responsiblity for anything that might happen to your device._

**IT'S BETTER IF YOU RUN EVERYTHING ON A TERMINAL USING `SUDO SU`**

This guide is made by me, but all the work is from oranav, a big shout out to him
